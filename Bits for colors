Image 


pixels == picture element

pixels == color > ??

how bits reltn with color 

we have colors = 2 ^ bpp (bits per pixel)

to represent image with two colors we have 2 ^ 1  = 2colors

similarly for rgb colors have approximately 256 colors to represent so 2 ^8 

there are 8 bits per each pixel for this case.
